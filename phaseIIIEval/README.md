# Summary of the formative feedback/findings we discovered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs


The usability testing was conducted with 6 participants and consisted of 4 tasks focused on key functionalities: Sign-up/Login Process, Group joining, Friend adding, and profile updating. 

The formative feedback gathered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs provides valuable insights into the current state of the FriendHub app, with a focus on the onboarding experience. Here are the key findings:

Loading Screen and Confirmation:

Positive feedback on the loading screen's visual feedback and progress bar.
Confirmation messages are clear, but subtle visual enhancements could further engage users.

Signup/Login Process:

Generally straightforward, but there's potential confusion between signup and login actions.
Users desire more contextual guidance or tooltips during the signup/login journey.

Friendship Dashboard Setup:

The app offers guidance, but there's room for improvement in certain elements.
Users may benefit from a guided tour feature for a more intuitive onboarding experience.

Overall Usability:

Positive aspects include a clean design, recognizable icons, and minimalistic aesthetics.
Areas for improvement involve error prevention, user guidance, and potentially overwhelming settings.

Optimization Opportunities:

Consider optimizing loading times to enhance user satisfaction.
Personalize confirmation messages for a more engaging experience.

Recommendations for Iterative Improvements:
Implement contextual guidance and tooltips to address signup/login confusion.
Explore the introduction of a guided tour feature for new users.
Enhance confirmation messages with subtle visual cues.
Optimize loading times for a seamless user experience.
Regularly gather user feedback to identify and address evolving user needs.

These findings serve as a foundation for iterative improvements, ensuring that FriendHub evolves into a user-friendly and engaging platform, especially during the critical onboarding phase.
