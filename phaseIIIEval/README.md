# Summary of the formative feedback/findings we discovered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs


The usability testing was conducted with 6 participants and consisted of 4 tasks focused on key functionalities: Sign-up/Login Process, Group joining, Friend adding, and profile updating. The formative feedback gathered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs provides valuable insights into the current state of the FriendHub app, with a focus on the onboarding experience. Here are the key findings:

Loading Screen and Confirmation:

Positive feedback on the loading screen's visual feedback and progress bar.
Confirmation messages are clear, but subtle visual enhancements could further engage users.

Signup/Login Process:

Generally straightforward, but there's potential confusion between signup and login actions.
Users desire more contextual guidance or tooltips during the signup/login journey.

Friendship Dashboard Setup:

The app offers guidance, but there's room for improvement in certain elements.
Users may benefit from a guided tour feature for a more intuitive onboarding experience.

Overall Usability:

Positive aspects include a clean design, recognizable icons, and minimalistic aesthetics.
Areas for improvement involve error prevention, user guidance, and potentially overwhelming settings.

Optimization Opportunities:

Consider optimizing loading times to enhance user satisfaction.
Personalize confirmation messages for a more engaging experience.

Recommendations for Iterative Improvements:
Implement contextual guidance and tooltips to address signup/login confusion.
Explore the introduction of a guided tour feature for new users.
Enhance confirmation messages with subtle visual cues.
Optimize loading times for a seamless user experience.
Regularly gather user feedback to identify and address evolving user needs.

These findings serve as a foundation for iterative improvements, ensuring that FriendHub evolves into a user-friendly and engaging platform, especially during the critical onboarding phase.

# An explanation of your overall approach to the study (e.g. formative vs summative, think-aloud, experimental, etc)


The overall approach to the study is formative, focusing on gathering insights to inform and refine the design of the FriendHub app.:

Formative Study:

Objective: The primary goal is to collect qualitative data that guides iterative improvements to the app's design and functionality.
Characteristics:
Iterative: The study is part of an iterative design process, allowing for continuous refinement based on user feedback.
Feedback-Oriented: Emphasis is on gathering user feedback to identify pain points, challenges, and areas of improvement.
Usability Testing: Tasks are designed to assess the usability of the app and identify areas for enhancement.

Qualitative Focus:

Objective: Prioritizing qualitative data helps understand user perceptions, preferences, and challenges in-depth.
Methods:
Think-Aloud Protocol: Participants are encouraged to verbalize their thoughts, providing insights into their decision-making process and feelings.
Open-Ended Questions: Debrief and concluding questions are designed to gather qualitative feedback on overall experiences, likes, dislikes, and suggestions.

Iterative Design Process:

Objective: The study is positioned within the larger context of an iterative design approach.
Characteristics:
Continuous Feedback Loop: Findings from the study will feed into the design process for ongoing improvements.
User-Centric: Emphasizes a user-centered approach, ensuring that design decisions align with user needs and expectations.

Task-Oriented Assessment:

Objective: Tasks are carefully crafted to assess specific aspects of the user experience, covering onboarding, social interaction, and profile management.
Components of UX:
Learnability, Efficiency, User Control: Tasks are aligned with these UX components to gain insights into the user's ability to learn, perform tasks efficiently, and feel in control.

Think-Aloud Method:

Objective: Leveraging think-aloud protocols to capture real-time thoughts and reactions during task execution.
Benefits:
Insights into Decision-Making: Unveils the user's decision-making process and emotional responses.
Identifying Pain Points: Helps identify areas of confusion, frustration, or delight during task completion.

In summary, the approach is rooted in formative, qualitative research, utilizing the think-aloud method and task-oriented assessments within an iterative design framework. This approach ensures a user-centric focus, continuous improvement, and a thorough understanding of user experiences to enhance the FriendHub app.
