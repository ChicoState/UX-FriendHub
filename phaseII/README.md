# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The project addresses the challenge of fostering meaningful friendships in the digital age through the development of FriendHub. This phase focuses on refining interactions and designing wireframes to ensure a user-friendly and engaging experience.


## Methods

* Cognitive Walkthroughs: Evaluated the onboarding and login processes for clarity and user guidance.
* Wireframe Design: Created detailed wireframes for key app features, emphasizing user-centric design.
* Usability Test Plan: Developed a plan for real-world testing, covering navigation, location sharing, group interactions, and more.


## Findings

Cognitive Walkthroughs:

* Positive Aspects: Loading screen and confirmation message enhance user experience.
* Areas for Improvement: Signup/login confusion and a need for more guidance on certain elements.


Wireframe Design:

* Main Login Wireframes: Explored seamless login experiences and homepage navigation.
* Homepage and Profiles: Focused on clarity and ease of navigation for users.
* Usability Test Plan:

Identified key objectives for navigation, location sharing, group interactions, logout, recommendations, profile updates, and icon usage.
Defined screening criteria, study design, and task-based scenarios for a comprehensive evaluation.


## Conclusions

Interpretation:

* Positive aspects, like confirmation messages, contribute to a confident user experience.
* Identified areas for improvement guide further design iterations.

Recommendations:

* Address signup/login confusion through clearer distinctions and additional guidance.
* Prioritize user guidance elements to enhance the purpose and functionality understanding.


## Caveats

Limitations:

* Findings may not capture the entire user spectrum; continuous testing is essential.
* Assumptions about user preferences may evolve; ongoing research is necessary.

Considerations:

* The usability test plan covers diverse scenarios, but real-world user behavior may vary.
* The findings provide insights, but user feedback is dynamic; constant iteration is crucial.

Future Work:

* Continued user testing, iterative design refinements, and adaptation to evolving user needs are vital for FriendHub's success.
* Regularly incorporating user feedback ensures a responsive and user-centric app throughout its development.
