# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The project addresses the challenge of fostering meaningful friendships in the digital age through the development of FriendHub. This phase focuses on refining interactions and designing wireframes to ensure a user-friendly and engaging experience.


## Methods

 For cognitive walkthroughs we evaluated the onboarding and login processes for clarity and user guidance. The wireframe design was created in detail for key app features, emphasizing user-centric design. The team developed a plan for real-world testing, covering navigation, location sharing, group interactions, and more.


## Findings

Cognitive Walkthroughs:

Loading screen and confirmation message enhance user experience. Areas for improvement include signup/login confusion and a need for more guidance on certain elements.


Wireframe Design:

Explored seamless login experiences and homepage navigation. Focused on clarity and ease of navigation for users. Identified key objectives for navigation, location sharing, group interactions, logout, recommendations, profile updates, and icon usage.
Defined screening criteria, study design, and task-based scenarios for a comprehensive evaluation.


## Conclusions

Interpretation:

Positive aspects, like confirmation messages, contribute to a confident user experience. Identified areas for improvement guide further design iterations. Address signup/login confusion through clearer distinctions and additional guidance. Prioritize user guidance elements to enhance the purpose and functionality understanding.


## Caveats



Findings may not capture the entire user spectrum; continuous testing is essential. Assumptions about user preferences may evolve; ongoing research is necessary. The usability test plan covers diverse scenarios, but real-world user behavior may vary.
The findings provide insights, but user feedback is dynamic; constant iteration is crucial.

Future Work:

Continued user testing, iterative design refinements, and adaptation to evolving user needs are vital for FriendHub's success. Regularly incorporating user feedback ensures a responsive and user-centric app throughout its development.
