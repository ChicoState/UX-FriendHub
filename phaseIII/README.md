# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The project aims to address the challenge of providing a seamless onboarding experience for users joining the FriendHub app. This interval of work focuses on understanding user interactions during the initial setup, group joining, friend adding, and profile editing tasks. The overarching goal is to enhance the usability and user satisfaction of FriendHub's onboarding process.


## Methods

We employed a combination of heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing to gain comprehensive insights into user experiences. Heuristic Evaluation: Leveraged usability heuristics to evaluate the current design against industry standards, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. Cognitive Walkthroughs: Simulated user interactions to assess the app's intuitiveness and discover potential usability issues. Usability Testing: Conducted task-based testing with mock users to observe real-time user behaviors, challenges faced, and preferences during onboarding tasks.


## Findings

Heuristic Evaluation:

Strengths: Clear visibility of system status and good match with real-world scenarios.
Areas for Improvement: Error prevention and user guidance can be enhanced for a smoother onboarding experience.
Cognitive Walkthroughs:

Positive: Loading screen and confirmation messages enhance user experience.
Areas for Improvement: Signup/login confusion and more guidance needed on certain elements.
Usability Testing:

Positive: Users found navigation easy and animations engaging.
Areas for Improvement: Confusion caused by login button on signup page; Lack of understanding between groups and friends.


## Conclusions

The heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs highlight the need for refined error prevention mechanisms and increased guidance, particularly during signup/login processes. Usability testing uncovered positive responses to animations and straightforward navigation but revealed confusion around the distinction between groups and friends.

Design Recommendations:

Implement clearer error prevention mechanisms during signup/login.
Enhance user guidance through tooltips or explanatory pop-ups for ambiguous elements.
Clarify the purpose of groups and friends through introductory information.
Optimize the login flow for a more intuitive onboarding experience.


## Caveats

Limited demographic diversity in usability testing may affect the generalizability of findings.
Findings are based on mock user data, and real-user experiences might vary.
The study assumes a moderate level of user familiarity with social apps.
These findings and recommendations provide valuable insights into refining FriendHub's onboarding process, but future work should consider broader user diversity and conduct iterative testing for continuous improvement.
