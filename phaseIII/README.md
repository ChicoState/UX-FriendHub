# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The project aims to address the challenge of providing a seamless onboarding experience for users joining the FriendHub app. This interval of work focuses on understanding user interactions during the initial setup, group joining, friend adding, and profile editing tasks. The overarching goal is to enhance the usability and user satisfaction of FriendHub's onboarding process.


## Methods

We employed a combination of heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing to gain comprehensive insights into user experiences. Heuristic Evaluation: Leveraged usability heuristics to evaluate the current design against industry standards, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. Cognitive Walkthroughs: Simulated user interactions to assess the app's intuitiveness and discover potential usability issues. Usability Testing: Conducted task-based testing with mock users to observe real-time user behaviors, challenges faced, and preferences during onboarding tasks.


## Findings

Heuristic Evaluation:

Strengths: Clear visibility of system status and good match with real-world scenarios.
Areas for Improvement: Error prevention and user guidance can be enhanced for a smoother onboarding experience.
Cognitive Walkthroughs:

Positive: Loading screen and confirmation messages enhance user experience.
Areas for Improvement: Signup/login confusion and more guidance needed on certain elements.
Usability Testing:

Positive: Users found navigation easy and animations engaging.
Areas for Improvement: Confusion caused by login button on signup page; Lack of understanding between groups and friends.


## Conclusions

The heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs highlight the need for refined error prevention mechanisms and increased guidance, particularly during signup/login processes. Usability testing uncovered positive responses to animations and straightforward navigation but revealed confusion around the distinction between groups and friends.

Design Recommendations:

Implement clearer error prevention mechanisms during signup/login.
Enhance user guidance through tooltips or explanatory pop-ups for ambiguous elements.
Clarify the purpose of groups and friends through introductory information.
Optimize the login flow for a more intuitive onboarding experience.


## Caveats

Limited demographic diversity in usability testing may affect the generalizability of findings.
Findings are based on mock user data, and real-user experiences might vary.
The study assumes a moderate level of user familiarity with social apps.
These findings and recommendations provide valuable insights into refining FriendHub's onboarding process, but future work should consider broader user diversity and conduct iterative testing for continuous improvement.

# Summary of the formative feedback/findings we discovered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs


The usability testing was conducted with 6 participants and consisted of 4 tasks focused on key functionalities: Sign-up/Login Process, Group joining, Friend adding, and profile updating. The formative feedback gathered from the heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthroughs provides valuable insights into the current state of the FriendHub app, with a focus on the onboarding experience. Here are the key findings:

Loading Screen and Confirmation:

Positive feedback on the loading screen's visual feedback and progress bar.
Confirmation messages are clear, but subtle visual enhancements could further engage users.

Signup/Login Process:

Generally straightforward, but there's potential confusion between signup and login actions.
Users desire more contextual guidance or tooltips during the signup/login journey.

Friendship Dashboard Setup:

The app offers guidance, but there's room for improvement in certain elements.
Users may benefit from a guided tour feature for a more intuitive onboarding experience.

Overall Usability:

Positive aspects include a clean design, recognizable icons, and minimalistic aesthetics.
Areas for improvement involve error prevention, user guidance, and potentially overwhelming settings.

Optimization Opportunities:

Consider optimizing loading times to enhance user satisfaction.
Personalize confirmation messages for a more engaging experience.

Recommendations for Iterative Improvements:
Implement contextual guidance and tooltips to address signup/login confusion.
Explore the introduction of a guided tour feature for new users.
Enhance confirmation messages with subtle visual cues.
Optimize loading times for a seamless user experience.
Regularly gather user feedback to identify and address evolving user needs.

These findings serve as a foundation for iterative improvements, ensuring that FriendHub evolves into a user-friendly and engaging platform, especially during the critical onboarding phase.
