# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The project aims to address the challenge of providing a seamless onboarding experience for users joining the FriendHub app. This interval of work focuses on understanding user interactions during the initial setup, group joining, friend adding, and profile editing tasks. The overarching goal is to enhance the usability and user satisfaction of FriendHub's onboarding process.


## Methods

We employed a combination of heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing to gain comprehensive insights into user experiences. Heuristic Evaluation: Leveraged usability heuristics to evaluate the current design against industry standards, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. Cognitive Walkthroughs: Simulated user interactions to assess the app's intuitiveness and discover potential usability issues. Usability Testing: Conducted task-based testing with mock users to observe real-time user behaviors, challenges faced, and preferences during onboarding tasks.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
