## Methods
For our competitive analysis we came up with two main competitors: Snapchat and Life360. The main weakness we found for Snapchat was that users interact with an extensive amount of bots and unnecessary content. With Life360 the main weakness we discovered was that users don't have full control of their location radius, so if a user doesn't want another user to check their specific location, it is not possible. Our user goal was to design a minimalistic, easy-to-learn application that allows user to share their location and status with other users.  It also has groups that users could join and interact with other users based on hobbies, interests, etc.

## Findings
* Users appreciate the idea of controlling the level of detail shared, suggesting a need for adjustable zoom levels.
* Users value context-aware sharing, where the platform suggests appropriate times and groups for location sharing.
* Users expect a friend list to view the added people in their account 

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
