## Methods
For our competitive analysis we came up with two main competitors: Snapchat and Life360. The main weakness we found for Snapchat was that users interact with an extensive amount of bots and unnecessary content. With Life360 the main weakness we discovered was that users don't have full control of their location radius, so if a user doesn't want another user to check their specific location, it is not possible. Our user goal was to design a minimalistic, easy-to-learn application that allows user to share their location and status with other users.  It also has groups that users could join and interact with other users based on hobbies, interests, etc.

## Findings
* Users appreciate the idea of controlling the level of detail shared, suggesting a need for adjustable zoom levels.
* Users value context-aware sharing, where the platform suggests appropriate times and groups for location sharing.
* Users expect a friend list to view the added people in their account 

## Conclusions
* Develop features that strike a balance between practical planning (Events and Plans) and emotional bonding (Friendship Score, shared experiences).
* Emphasize robust privacy controls and communicate clearly with users about data security measures.
* Address the need for both in-person and virtual interaction features, catering to users with diverse social preferences. Meaningful Connection to build features that foster deeper connections, going beyond the superficial interactions found on mainstream social media.

## Caveats
### Competitive and Heuristic Analysis
The competitive analysis is based on a select group of competitors and might not encompass the full market landscape. Heuristic evaluations rely on expert judgment; actual user testing may reveal additional insights and perspectives. The absence of user data limits the depth of understanding regarding specific user preferences and behaviors.

### Reproducibility
The research methods assume a standardized context and may need adjustments based on unique project requirements.External factors, such as evolving technology standards, may impact the applicability of these methods over time. The findings are based on the available information and may require validation as the industry and user expectations evolve.
